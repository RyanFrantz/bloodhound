An old project I wrote to sniff out files and do something useful with them.

CAVEAT
------

This whole thing is a mess that I should have refactored, but never did.

Also, this code was written with a *very* specific environment in mind (I think I used Cygwin at one point). Tread lightly if you choose to use this code in whole, or in part.
